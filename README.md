# Striver's SDE Sheet Visualizations

This repository contains **visualizations and animations** for solving problems from [Striver's SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems). The aim is to provide an intuitive understanding of the data structures and algorithms covered in the sheet through visual guides.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§
This project is a **work in progress**, and new visualizations will be added as more questions are implemented.

## Features
- Animations and visual guides for each problem.
- Simple Python scripts to generate and run visualizations.
- Helps in understanding the underlying algorithm for each problem visually.

## Installation

To clone and run the visualizations, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SubratDash67/Striver-SDE-Sheet-Visualizations.git
    cd Striver-SDE-Sheet-Visualizations
    ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Visualizations**:

    Each problem's visualization can be run using simple Python scripts. For example, to run the visualization for **Inorder Traversal**, use:

    ```bash
    python inorder.py
    ```

    Replace `inorder.py` with the appropriate script for the problem you want to visualize.

## How It Works
Each Python script corresponds to a problem from Striver's SDE Sheet and contains an animated visualization of the problem's solution. The visualizations demonstrate the steps involved in solving the problem, such as how data structures are manipulated, how recursion unfolds, etc.

### Example:
For **Inorder Traversal** visualization, running the script `inorder.py` will show how the algorithm traverses the binary tree step by step.
